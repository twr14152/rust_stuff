# rust_stuff

I'm trying to learn Rust. This repository will be a wasteland of notes and examples.

Reading "The Book", on the website. So far, so good, and then I reached the chapter on enums.
Time for a break!


rust_notes.rs - Is a way for me to test concepts covered in the book by creating a long program, rather than a bunch of short ones. Sometimes its a stretch to say its a good way to prove a concept.
